<h4>About the dataset</h4>
<p>Our goal at <em>Our World in Data</em> is to provide testing data over time for many countries around the world.</p>
<p>To do this, we collect publicly available information published by official sources on a regular basis. Our dataset
    is updated around twice a week.</p>
<p>Alongside the data, we also aim to provide a good understanding of the definitions used and any important limitations
    they might have. Our <a
        href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#our-checklist-for-covid-19-testing-data">checklist of
        questions</a> about testing data is what guides our efforts.</p>
<p>We present this information in source descriptions for each country included in the dataset. But in many cases
    sources do not yet provide the detailed descriptions of the data we would like.</p>
